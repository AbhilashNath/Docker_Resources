Below are step-by-step instructions to install Docker on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Additionally, I'll provide links to the official Docker documentation for each platform.

Install Docker on Windows:
Prerequisites:
Ensure that your Windows version is Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education, with Hyper-V support.
Hyper-V should be enabled in your system's BIOS.

Double-click the installer file to start the installation.

Follow the installation wizard instructions. It may prompt you to enable Hyper-V and restart your computer during the process.

Once the installation is complete, Docker Desktop will start automatically.

Make sure your Linux distribution supports Docker.
Users need to have sudo privileges.

Update the package index:

sudo apt-get update
Install Docker dependencies:

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
Add Docker's official GPG key:

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
Set up the stable Docker repository:

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
Update the package index again:

sudo apt-get update
Install Docker:

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
Start and enable Docker service:

sudo systemctl start docker
